# Maze Generator

a Maze generator inspired by cl√©ment mihailescu's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg) specifically [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/)

I did not look at the project and just thought of how I could do this, and thought <canvas> is the right way to do it.

Created with React and the Canvas HTML element

Practiced scripts and tests in here

Archiving to keep these examples for myself.

Figured that I would be more able to handle the elements if they were HTML elements in react. Still proud of the progress I made on the scripts which is why I am not deleting this
